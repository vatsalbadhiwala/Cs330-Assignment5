http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~vbt939/CS330/Login.html

Brief Description Of my project:
- I have tried to describe how file management works in this project. First i 
have created a welcome page and which will take you to your list of directories
 present in the system and then i have tried to show how many functions can be
 performed to a specific directory, Which are Adding a new directory to the 
system, deleting an existing directory from the system, Open and close any
directory, edit the number of document present in that directory.
After entering a directory in the system You can see the number of files 
present in that directory, which takes us to Discuss about processes 
performed for files, A file can be opened, closed, deleted, Truncate etc;
hile after opening a file you can either add data in your file or delete 
the data from the file or leave it as it is.

I have tried to perform similar function online with the help of HTML, CSS,
And PHP, 
I made a page for directory and tried to perform some functions on it:
-Open a directory;
-Close a directory;
-Ass/Edit/Delete a directory (was not able to finish this part of the project)

then i made a page for file Management and tried to perform some functions on it:
- Open/ Close file,
- move back too directory page,
- Add/ Delete data from the file,
- view of data in the table,
- Add/Delete a file from the system.(Was not able to finish this part of the project)

then i made another page where you can Add/ Delete data from a file,
